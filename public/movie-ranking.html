<h1>The Best Movies According To Mohammed Gamal</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.</p>
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>The movie Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten an Oscar for. His portrayal of the character is perfect. The movie is well-written, leaving no details out of the original story. Martin Scorsese never fails to impress. One of the only example where the movie is better than the book. The movie never gets boring, I could watch this anytime.</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

    Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
    
    Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
    
    Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
    
    If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
    
    This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest,.</p>
